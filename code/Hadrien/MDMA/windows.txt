This file describes the modifications necessary to compile in windows

additional qmake arguments: -spec win32-g++
(in qtcreator: qmake part in project configuration)

INCLUDEPATH += opencv include path (opencv install/build/include)
LIBS += correct stuff (opencv lib path + libs with version number)
CONFIG += exceptions (why is this necessary? no clue, but otherwise -fno-exceptions is added to the flags given to mingw)

bin\rcc.exe to rcc.exe (done in the .pro)
